Informal spec:
* Return type constraints (where we actually know them)

Esos:
* can cast with `__cast(1.0, myvar)`
* Flow control -> add switch statement (take cases, build them into a list, if case is true rewrite switch statement to body of case, otherwise rewrite to switch statement, otherwise default)

* Create handles in java, and return that from object-creating constructors (maybe not for music but explain in report), i.e. map + bimap (although have for channels and bpm?)

Plugin:
* DEFINITELY add dynamics
* dotted notes
 shepard tone? maybe not

 jar files + scripts were good
