Questions to ask adrian:
* Semantics of for loop:
  * attribute/action: initialiser is an expression or assignment,
    but esos just a statement..
    Difference in semantics: AA is "better" in that esos would allow things like while loops as iniitalisers??
  * Would correct thing be to write different types of rules for different
    statements? Very hard in esos, write about this...
* Can switch statement be briefer in esos?
